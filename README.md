Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

This repository provides an implementation for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques.
The DRL framework is adapted from wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route

To ensure robustness and performance benchmarking, several classical optimization algorithms are also implemented for validation and comparison, including:
Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Simulated Annealing (SA)
Nearest Neighbour Heuristic (NN)
Google OR-Tools Solver
